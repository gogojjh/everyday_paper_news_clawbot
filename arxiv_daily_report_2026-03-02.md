- **arXiv**: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22896v1)
- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable success in robotic tasks like manipulation by fusing a language model's reasoning with a vision model's 3D understanding. However, their high computational cost remains a major obstacle for real-world applications that require real-time perfo...

### 4. GraspLDP: Towards Generalizable Grasping Policy via Latent Diffusion

- **arXiv**: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22663v1)
- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a generalist robotic agent. However, existing VLAs are hindered by excessive parameter scales, prohibitive pre-training requirements, and limited applicability to diverse embodiments. To improve the practicality of VLAs, we propose a comprehensive ...

- **arXiv**: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22579v1)
- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are multimodal robotic task controllers that, given an instruction and visual inputs, produce a sequence of low-level control actions (or motor commands) enabling a robot to execute the requested task in the physical environment. These systems face the test oracle...

### 8. SignVLA: A Gloss-Free Vision-Language-Action Framework for Real-Time Sign Language-Guided Robotic Manipulation

- **Summary**: We present, to our knowledge, the first sign language-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework for intuitive and inclusive human-robot interaction. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on gloss annotations as intermediate supervision, the proposed system adopts a gloss-free paradigm and dir...

### 9. When to Act, Ask, or Learn: Uncertainty-Aware Policy Steering
- **Authors**: Jessie Yuan, Yilin Wu, Andrea Bajcsy
- **Affiliation**: 附属单位未提供
- **Published**: 2026-02-25
- **arXiv**: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22474v1)
- **Summary**: Policy steering is an emerging way to adapt robot behaviors at deployment-time: a learned verifier analyzes low-level action samples proposed by a pre-trained policy (e.g., diffusion policy) and selects only those aligned with the task. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are promising general-purpo...
